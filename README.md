<p align="center">‚ú® A tiny utility to generate short, deterministic, pseudo-unique hashes ‚Äî not for security, just for fun and function.</p>

Years ago, while working on a PHP project, I stumbled upon a brilliant little gem called [PseudoCrypt](https://web.archive.org/web/20130727034425/http://blog.kevburnsjr.com/php-unique-hash) by KevBurnsJr. It gave me compact, reversible hashes for integer IDs ‚Äî just what I needed for pretty URLs.

Fast-forward to today, while building a Node + Express app, I wanted that same functionality. Nostalgia kicked in ‚Äî so I re-imagined the logic in JavaScript, packed it into a clean NPM module, and now, I'm sharing it with the world.

## üì¶ Installation

To install PseudoCrypt via npm and use it in your Node.js projects:

```bash
npm i @cttricks/pseudocrypt
```

If you're building a front-end application or prefer to load PseudoCrypt directly in the browser, you can include it from the jsdelivr cdn.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cttricks/pseudocrypt@v1.0.0/dist/pseudocrypt.min.js"></script>
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

```js
const { encode, decode } = require('@cttricks/pseudocrypt');

const shortId = encode(1320588); // HdMxQ
const original = decode(shortId); // 1320588

```
> [!TIP]
> You can also customize the hash length
> ```js
> const hash = encode(123456, 7);  
> ```

## üìö API
### encode(number, length = 5)
- Converts a number into a short, base62-like string.
- Length determines the padded size of the output hash.

### decode(string)
- Reverses the encoded string back to the original number.

## üß† Use Cases
- URL shortening
- Obfuscating numeric IDs
- Pretty URLs
- Generating lightweight client-side keys

> [!WARNING]  
> This is not a cryptographic hash ‚Äî it‚Äôs meant for short pseudo-unique strings, not for passwords or secure encoding.

This little library was built with a blend of nostalgia, practicality, and a sprinkle of fun.
If it saved you a few lines of code or gave your project some cleaner URLs ‚Äî I‚Äôm glad it helped ‚ú®

Feel free to fork it, remix it, improve it, or just drop a ‚≠ê on GitHub if you found it useful.
No formalities, no promises ‚Äî just code made with good vibes.

‚Äî

Happy hashing! üöÄ
