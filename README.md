✨ A tiny utility to generate short, deterministic, pseudo-unique hashes — not for security, just for fun and function.


## ✍️ The Backstory

Years ago, while working on a PHP project, I stumbled upon a brilliant little gem called [PseudoCrypt](https://web.archive.org/web/20130727034425/http://blog.kevburnsjr.com/php-unique-hash) by KevBurnsJr. It gave me compact, reversible hashes for integer IDs — just what I needed for pretty URLs.

Fast-forward to today, while building a Node + Express app, I wanted that same functionality. Nostalgia kicked in — so I re-imagined the logic in JavaScript, packed it into a clean NPM module, and now, I'm sharing it with the world.

Enjoy the nostalgia-fueled hashing 🔁
